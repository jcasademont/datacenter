\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Related work}
Manual Controls - Thermo dynamic modelling - Workload management

\subsection{Assumptions}
Fixed layout - data for only one datacenter and one month -
Normally distributed - Paranormal distribution

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Find automated protocol to model datacenter temperature
    \item Find generative model to allow sampling
    \item Investigate controls of AHUs
\end{itemize}

\section{Undirected modelling}

\subsection{Background}
Markov Random Fields - GMRF (Multivariate gaussian) - Glasso - BIC

\subsection{Static analysis}
Correlation aanlysis (linear relationship) - Glasso failed to find sparse network

\subsection{Temporal analysis}
First order markov assumption - Result of GMRF - Simulated heatmap

\section{Hybrid modelling}

\subsection{Background}
Bayesian Network - Linear gaussian bayesian network (Multivariate gaussian) - Correlation ratio (non-linear relationship) - Hybrid Random Fields (set of Multivariate gaussian)

\subsection{Hybrid Random Fields}
Result of HRF - More accurate and better R2 than GMRF on first steps - Simulated heatmap

\section{Going Further: Controls}

\subsection{Background}
Reinforcement learning - Value function approximation

\subsection{Preliminary results}

\section{Conclusion}

Manage to accurately predict racks temperature based on past data. Start to investigate reinforcement learning based on those models

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lack of workload variables per racks
    \item Extend probabilistics model with nonparametric versions - use MCMC, Gibbs sampling
    \item Further investigate controls, more reinforcement learning but also rule-based, optimal controls \dots
\end{itemize}
