\section*{Project Plan}

\subsection*{Modelling}
\begin{itemize}

    \item Start modelling data using time independent model with continuous variables (eg GMRF).
    \begin{itemize}

        \item Network structure estimation (eg Graph Lasso)
        \item Parameter estimation (Point-based estimate, fully bayesian)

    \end{itemize}

\item Learn hybrid model with undirected edges and directed edges to represent discrete time.
    \begin{itemize}

        \item Estimate network structure and parameters
        \item Use time dependencies to predict data with one to several steps ahead.

    \end{itemize}

\item Mesure best model using model selection measure (eg: BIC) and absolute testing accuracy.


\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Simulation}
\begin{itemize}

    \item When a model is judged accurate enough using absolute testing accuracy, we move to simulation.

    \item Sample data from the model to augment the dataset.

    \item Use simulation to compute data for situations not occurring in the riginal dataset (eg a rack temperature going above $40^oC$).

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Control}
\begin{itemize}

    \item Use the augmented dataset and the predictive model to learn strategies for controlling the Air conditionning units.

    \item Develop strateges based on different utility functions (eg: Never exceed given temperatue thresholds, Save as much energy as possible)

\end{itemize}
